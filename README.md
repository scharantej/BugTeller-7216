## Overview
Analyzing your request, it appears that you would like to create a Flask application to generate a consolidated report for executives based on comments extracted from bug tracking systems.

## Design
We will utilize Python Flask to develop a functional web application. Here's the structure of your Flask application:

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: This will be your homepage, prompting users to enter bug tracking system URLs and provide other necessary information.
- **result.html**: It will display the generated report, presenting insights from the bug tracking comments.

### Routes
- **@app.route('/')**: Corresponds to the 'index.html' page. Users can input bug tracking URLs here.
- **@app.route('/generate_report', methods=['POST'])**: Upon form submission, this route extracts comments from the provided URLs, analyzes them, and stores the results in a database.
- **@app.route('/view_report')**: This route connects to the database to fetch and display the generated report in 'result.html'.

### Implementation
- Create a Python Flask app instance.
- Design 'index.html' and 'result.html' with appropriate input fields and display components.
- Implement the '/generate_report' route to connect to the bug tracking systems, extract comments, analyze them, and store the results in the database.
- Implement the '/view_report' route to retrieve data from the database and display it on 'result.html'.

This Flask application will centralize and analyze comments from multiple bug tracking systems, generating a comprehensive report tailored for executives.
